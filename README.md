# Data Note

There are two files in this repository. One is to clean the original data files, which have four different formats. I tried to organize it to a level I can easily extract data. In the other file, I showed some algorithms created to generate tables and visualization with statistical and business meaning.
I will also include some data visualization I presented in the annual operation report of the U-M Library.
